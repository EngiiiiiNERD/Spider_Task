# Looking through the mirror

>**For the past 19 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: 
'If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do 
today?' And whenever the answer has been 'No' for too many days in a row, I know 
I need to change something.**

*I enjoy the simple things in life. Being happy is a state
 of mind, and I don't think people should settle for less 
than they deserve. I always look toward the next best thing.
 I like seeing other people happy. When someone else is down,
 it breaks my heart. I've been through more than most people my
 age, but hey, it's what has made me stronger. Life has thrown 
me challenges, and so far, I've come out on top. I realized who
 my real friends are, and that my family always comes first..always.
.I love music and movies. Suits and GOT are my favorite TV shows...
There is more to life than beauty on the outside. It's about
 what's on the inside. That's what really counts.*
